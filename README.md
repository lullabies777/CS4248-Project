# CS4248-Project

### Demo
I found related tutorial online and this demo reproduces the work of https://aclanthology.org/D16-1058.pdf. The architecture of this model has been put in  `architecture` folder.

In order to run the demo successfully, you have to download the pre-trained word vectors, which is available at https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. I used `glove.6B.300d.txt` in this demo, remember to decompress this text file into the `data` folder.
